#### 1. The Terrestrial Boundary

Define that "Terrestrial" is a bounded sandbox.

- **The Error:** Using optical tools (Microscopes/Telescopes) to observe other scales while remaining physically and mathematically anchored in the Terrestrial ESS.
    
- **The Result:** "Data Smear." We see things that don't make sense (Quantum probability or Dark Matter) because we are looking through a "window" into a sandbox that has different nesting rules.

#### 2. The Physics of the "Static" Sandbox

From a Unometry viewpoint, Terrestrial Physics is defined by:

- **Fixed Resolution:** The scale where human biology and engineering operate.
    
- **Inertial Stasis:** We assume the "ground" is zero, but in a TAP system, "zero" is just the current pointer address.
    
- **0D to 3D Progression:** The linear algebra and calculus we use are "local" tools optimized for this specific ESS.
    

#### 3. The "No-Zoom" Policy

Explicitly state that in your SOP, you don't "zoom."

- To see the atom, you don't use a stronger lens; you **relocate the TAP**.
    
- You must leave the Terrestrial ESS and "Handshake" with the Atomic ESS.
    
- This prevents the "roughshod" math where terrestrial constants are forced onto non-terrestrial objects.
