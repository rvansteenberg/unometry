Lesson 1 Dynamic Context Discernment
Version 20260120:14:00
Words are complex structures the key is to understand the hierachical nature of their makeup.
You are probably familiar with initialisms and acronyms.
It is importatnt to be strict, accurate, and proficient. 
Example UFO is an initialism not an acronym.

Porphemes (Portmanteau Morpheme) you can now just use porpheme and use context to discern if its a portmanteau or morpheme.
Prefix Suffix -> Pix Fix Mix Six
Inextricably -> In = Pix, ex = Fix, tric = Mix, abl = Fix, y = Six

Then you can take word and derive new content
Inextricably - Intellectual Exchange Trick Ability (note ability requires recursion).

Word seach when trying to find words you need to be able to alpha sort and prioritize on brevity, vowels, context.
So the fix six of abl y allows you derive abilty.
Then you can create new words when you see pattterns of use.
For example if you were repeatedly doing word searches you call them swords because wearches sounds off.

The goal is contextual certainty not consensus probability, Though CP may help derive CC quiker. Note the Inist (Initialism Gist)
You can speed up conversations sort of like textaul gibberish when the context is apparent yet not attemping word standardization.
