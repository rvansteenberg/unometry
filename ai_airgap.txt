AirGap - Accelerat Information Range Gemini Access Protol

# (Version: [20260123::11:00])

Currently, there exists multiple hops between the host server at Github and the Gemini Ai.
As pages are refreshed at Github they are indexed by GSC, then cached by the Google CDN.
This makes dynamic conversations only possible via Cache - Cage Checks. The host site has to 
be updated and Gemini has to check the cache and both look for version consitency.
AI has a long way to go before it is free to address current real time information dynamically.
